Furthermore if $m$ only grows polynomially in the number of qubits $n$, we know that taking polynomially growing number of samples $s = O\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{C}^2 m^2}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)$ from $|\\langle x| \\psi_p(\\vec{\\gamma},\\vec{\\beta}) \\rangle |^2$ will be sufficient to obtain a $x^*$ that leads to an $C(x^*)$ that will be close to $M_p$."

The graph will be defined below and corresponds to the native connectivity of the device. This allows us to implement the original version of the $QAOA$ algorithm, where the cost - function $C$ and the Hamiltonian $H$ that is used to generate the state coincide. Moreover, for such a simple graph the exact cost function can be calculated analytically. To implement the circuit, we follow the notation and gate defintions from the [Qiskit Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/)."
